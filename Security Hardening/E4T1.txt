# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1) Web Service Instnace Security group should remove all traffic from internet and restrict the access only from local ip address
2) Web Service Instance Security group should remove SSH traffic.
3) Move Web Service Instance to Private Security group and create bastian host for SSH access.
4) Configure password complexity/adding passphrase is recommended
5) Remove username/password access from EC2 instance. So that only keypair access is allowed for SSH. 


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1) Add bucket policy that denies any access to the secret recipies.(least privelege access rule) 
2) Encrypt secret recipies.
