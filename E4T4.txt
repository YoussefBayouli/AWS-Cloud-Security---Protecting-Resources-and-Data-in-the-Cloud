# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Move Web Application Instance to Private Subnet and allow traffic to port 5000 only from ELB. NAT gateway can be added for outbound internet traffic for patch updates.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, creating VPC private endpoints will not prevent the unauthorized access to secret bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Encryption will apply to newly added files after encryption is enabled. It will not apply to data that already exists.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Running original Clound Formation Teamplates will override the changes.
